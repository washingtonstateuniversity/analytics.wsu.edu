          <h3>About this Site</h3>
          <p>
            This data provides a window into how people are interacting with the government online. The data comes from a unified Google Analytics account for U.S. federal government agencies known as the <a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/" class="external-link">Digital Analytics Program</a>. This program helps government agencies understand how people find, access, and use government services online. The program <a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/common-questions-about-dap-faq/#part-4" class="external-link">does not track individuals</a>, and <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en" class="external-link">anonymizes the IP addresses</a> of visitors.
          </p>

          <p>
            Not every government website is represented in this data. Currently, the Digital Analytics Program collects web traffic from around <a href="https://analytics.usa.gov/data/live/second-level-domains.csv" class="external-link">400 executive branch government domains</a>, across <a href="https://analytics.usa.gov/data/live/sites.csv" class="external-link">about 5000 total websites</a>, including every cabinet department. We continue to pursue and add more sites frequently; to add your site, <a href="mailto:DAP@support.digitalgov.gov" class="external-link">email the Digital Analytics Program</a>.
          </p>
